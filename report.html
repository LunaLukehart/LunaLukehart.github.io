// link to deployed app: https://lunalukehart.github.io/

// what the app does:
// Inputting a word in the search bar and clicking search will fetch an inspirational quote that contains that word
// (if a word is input that is not located in any quote, no quote will be generated)

// how it satisfies requirements:
// publicly deployed on github
// the formatting will change on smaller sized screens (will add padding to make it look better)
// uses the Quotable and Shibe Online APIs
// search bar that the user can interact with
